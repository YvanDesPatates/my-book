# React website to present my book

Hi, I'm Yvan and this is my book. It summarizes my learnings from the past 4 years in the field of software development. I hope you'll like it!

You can find the book [here](https://yvandespatates.github.io/my-book/).

It is automatically published from the `main` branch using ci-cd :)

### Launch the site locally for the first time :

```
npm i
npm run start
```
